Employee Payroll System

A console-based Employee Payroll System developed in C++ using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
This project demonstrates clean class design, inheritance, runtime polymorphism, and modern C++ memory management.

Features

- Add Full-Time Employees
- Add Part-Time Employees
- Calculate salary dynamically based on employee type
- Display all employee details
- Search employee by ID
- Delete employee by ID
- Menu-driven console interface


OOP Concepts Used

- Encapsulation – Data members are protected and accessed via methods
- Inheritance – Employee base class with derived classes
- Polymorphism – Virtual functions and runtime binding
- Abstraction – Pure virtual function for salary calculation
- Modern C++ – unique_ptr for safe memory management
- STL – vector, algorithm


Class Structure

- Employee (Abstract Base Class)
- FullTimeEmployee (Derived Class)
- PartTimeEmployee (Derived Class)
- PayrollSystem (Manages employees and operations)

 
 Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Concepts: OOP, STL
